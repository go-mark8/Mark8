# GitHub Actions workflow: run tests, build a release APK, and upload the APK as an artifact.
# - Produces an APK artifact on pushes/PRs to ethio_market_app.
# - Optionally decodes and uses a signed keystore from repo secrets (recommended).

# Place this file at: .github/workflows/flutter-ci-signed.yml
